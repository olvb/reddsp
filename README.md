## Redo DDSP

ReDDSP is a PyTorch reimplementation of Google's [Differentiable DSP][1]. For now it only features the simpler version of the network plugged to an additive + noise synthesizer (no z-encoder, no reverb). It is still WIP but already operational.

NB: The code in this repository is based on collective work by fellow [ATIAM][2] students as part of [Philippe Esling][3]'s course on machine learning for music.
